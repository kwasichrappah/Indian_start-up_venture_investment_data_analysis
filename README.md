## Conclusion
From my analysis,it is realised that :
- Many startups located in the Bangalore have the highest average investments as compared to other cities therefore it will be easier to find viable startups to invest in that city.
- There is a high average investment needed for the E-Commerce & Retail Sector Sector, an investor is adviced to ventor into other sectors such as Energy,Hospitality,Agriculture and Technology & Software.
- Though many startups looked for other sources of funding such as Debt financing, there are still many other startups in the Seed financing category that investors can invest into.
